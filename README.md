# startup

(sketches in the startup folder not in the README.md)
My idea is for a website that proccesses a jersey order an individual would make for their team, with them filling out the number and name they want on the jersey, the size, color, and other basic information. They could also be able to see the orders they placed and view the information on them. In addition, the website would provide templates for the user with different colors. If they click on one, they are directed to the order placement screen with the info for color already filled out. There could also be a support page with contact information as well as account settings the user could modify.
