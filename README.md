# Startup

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For a long time, I've played Ultimate Frisbee. Whenever I tell people I play Ultimate, they usually have no idea how to play it and think it's easy when it can actually be pretty complicated. So I thought I would make an informative website that explains the rules for Ultimate and mentions some good Ultimate players. You'll have to login to access the site, and you could be able to give a "like" to an Ultimate player on my website that's stored on a database and can be seen by anyone else on the site. It could also be able to retrieve weather conditions like temperature or wind speed because good weather is important when playing Ultimate.
