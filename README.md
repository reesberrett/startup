# Startup

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For a long time, I've played Ultimate Frisbee. Whenever I tell people I play Ultimate, they usually have no idea how to play it and think it's easy when it can actually be pretty complicated. So I thought I would make an informative website that explains the rules for Ultimate and mentions some good Ultimate players. You'll have to login to access the site, and you could be able to give a "like" to an Ultimate player on my website that's stored on a database and can be seen by anyone else on the site. It could also be able to retrieve weather conditions like temperature or wind speed because good weather is important when playing Ultimate.  

## Applying concepts
- **HTML** - 5 HTML pages, one for login, four for displaying website content
- **CSS** - applying style that looks good and adapts to different screen sizes
- **JavaScript** - using for code for login, "likes", and for retreiving weather data
- **Service** - backend service with endpoints for
  - login
  - retrieving and submiting "likes"
  - retreiving data about weather
- **DB** - stores user data and "likes" in a database
- **Login** - registers and logs in users and storres their credentials in database
- **WebSocket** - each user's "like" is visible to others
- **React** - application ported to use React framework
