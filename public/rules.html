      <p>These are some of the basic rules of Ultimate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You can throw and catch as many times as you want per point, but if the defending team counts ten seconds that you have the disc, a <b>stall</b> is called and results in a turnover</li><br>

        <li>When you catch the disc, you can only pivot on one foot (Usually right-handed people pivot on their left foot and left-handed people use their right). You can only move if you had momentum when you caught the disc and take a few steps to come to a stop. Otherwise a <b>travel</b> is called and also results in a turnover</li><br>

        <li>If a player on the offense doesn't catch the disc, or if a player on defense can hit the disc out of the air before or catch it before anyone else does, then the defense gets a chance to score. This continues until one team is able to catch the disc in the opposite end zone from where they started from</li><br>
        
        <li>Ultimate games don't have a referee and any violation of the rules is called by a player. The players talk it over and the person that the violation is called on can contest the violation. If they contest it, the disc goes back to whoever threw it last</li>

        <ul>
          <li>(Some Ultimate games, however, have an <b>observer</b> who cannot make calls on his own, &amp; assists and informs them of Ultimate rules so that the players can make decisions for themselves)</li><br>
        </ul>
